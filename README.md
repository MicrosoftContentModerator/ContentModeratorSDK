Microsoft Content Moderator SDK
===================
The following solution provides a sample SDK showcasing how to use Microsoft Content Moderator Service.

To use the SDK:

 1. Visit the [Microsoft Content Moderator site](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Moderator/Documentation) for information on how to sign up and get the appropriate Subscription Keys.
 2. Enlist the Github project and open the ContentModeratorSDK project. (Note, you'll need VisualStudio 2015 to open the project. Get it [here](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs.aspx))
 3. To test out the SDK and service, update the Key in the Test file under contentmoderatorsdk.tests\contentmoderatortest.cs in the initialize method. Then you should be able to run the tests, which highlight the current set of core user scenarios for the service.
